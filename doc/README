CLASS automatic documentation folders
=====================================
(Deanna Hooper, 25.03.2016)

* the automatically generated PDF manual can be found in

    doc/manual/CLASS_MANUAL.pdf

* the files in doc/input/ are auxiliary files for generating it

* if you wish to update this manual yourself using doxygen, look at instructions in section 6 of CLASS_MANUAL.pdf

* there is also an html version that you can access from the CLASS webpages. The html version used to be distributed together with CLASS, but we removed it because the html directory was too big. If you do wish to get the html source files on your own computer, you just need to recompile the manual with "cd doc/input/; ./make1.sh" (assuming that you have doxygen installed).
