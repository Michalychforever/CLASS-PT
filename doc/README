CLASS automatic documentation folders
=====================================
(Deanna Hooper, 25.03.2016)

* the automatically generated PDF manual can be found in

    doc/manual/CLASS_MANUAL.pdf

* or you can open the html version (actually nicer) with your browser: just open the file

    doc/manual/html/index.html

* the files in doc/input/ are auxiliary files for generating it

* if you wish to update this manual yourself using doxygen, look at instructions in section 6 of CLASS_MANUAL.pdf
