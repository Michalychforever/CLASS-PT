--> the one with the RSD "b1" terms was called brute_force_b1_complicated_term-retry.nb: "retry" because at first I was using WRONG dimensionless tricks, and then at the end I went back to using the tricks of Marko and co. Now, in the brute force case I use their tricks. In the FFT case I use mine... So it is a nontrivial check, i.e. and even more nontrivial check...

--> since now I will use a separable shape, these are actually NOT NEEDED, now that I also checked that the matrices in RS space were computed correctly. So I do NOT have such folder in the new Mac. I just compute the matrices with similar python scripts, in the same folders, and with adding some -orthogonal at the end! NO, THESE ARE NEEDED FOR THE BRUTE FORCE CHECKS! Which I will still do -> will send them later to the Mac.
