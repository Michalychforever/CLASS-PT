# CLASS-PT: nonlinear perturbation theory extension of the Boltzmann code CLASS

Authors: Mikhail (Misha) Ivanov and Anton Chudaykin 

with major inputs from other people, especially Marko Simonovic and Oliver Philcox

This is a modification of the CLASS code that computes the non-linear power spectra of dark matter and biased tracers in one-loop cosmological perturbation theory.
 
CLASS-PT can be interfaced with the MCMC sampler [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) using the custom-built likelihoods found [here](https://github.com/Michalychforever/lss_montepython).
 
The code is compatible with both python v2 and v3

# Getting started

Read [these instructions](https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT/blob/master/instructions.pdf) for the installation details. See also this [troubleshooting](https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT/blob/master/troubleshooting.rst) guide.

The installation instuctions for CLASS can be found on the official code webpage https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public

Once you are all set, check out this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT/blob/master/notebooks/nonlinear_pt.ipynb) for the examples of working sessions.

Also you can check this exhaustive [google collab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Cz6aSdf685hQALTBpcdTl9hs_CIvvML?usp=sharing) on the code and BOSS likelihoods.

You can also use the Mathematica notebook *'read_tables.nb'* to read the code output.

# Using the code

You can use CLASS-PT freely, provided that in your publications you cite at least the code paper [arXiv:2004.10607](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10607). Feel free to cite the other companion papers devoted to new large-scale structure analysis methodologies!
