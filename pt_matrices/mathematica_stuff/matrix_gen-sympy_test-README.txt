--> I didn't finish the script... I didn't export anything. I now have handle on sympy, the only issue is how to make it recognize inputs. It could be that I cannot pass to it anything but mpmath stuff? Maybe lambda-fying via numpy? I do not care too much... This is more than enough...

--> cannot use numpy for lambda-fying because it doesn't recognize the csc stuff. Ok, so I stop here. The script is NOT finished but has the gist of what one should do...

--> print(M12(-0.5*etam[1],-0.5*etam[3])) is what fails, for example... Because of "type" stuff...
