To use this python wrapper for class, you should first compile class with 'make all', not just 'make class': this is important in order to create libraries. Be sure that you did not remove the -fPIC compiling flag in the Makefile, important for compatibility between OpenMP and the python wrapper.

Check that the command 'python' points towards a version of python > 2.7 but < 3.0. Then, execute:

> python setup.py build
> python setup.py install --user

(it's really 'user', not your own user name).

You can check that these steps worked by typing

> python
>>> from classy import Class

If python does not complain, the Class module has been correctly installed in your python distribution. You can now import it and use its functions from your python codes.
